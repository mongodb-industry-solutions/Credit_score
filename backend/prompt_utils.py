    ##Instruction: 
    - Take into account the Definitions of various feature fields and their respective values given as input to the AI/ML model used to predict a person's Credit Score Health.  
    - Provide a detailed reason in layman language as to why a Credit request was **approved** or **rejected**, given the profile of the candidate.  
    - Use the following structure in your response:
    - If the profile is **rejected**, clearly state:  
        "The suggestion to reject the application of [Name] with credit health classified as '[Credit Health]' can be attributed to several factors."  
        Avoid mentioning credit limit if the application is rejected.
    - If the profile is **approved**, clearly state:  
        "The suggestion to approve the application of [Name] with credit health classified as '[Credit Health]' and to provide a credit limit of [$Credit Limit] can be attributed to several factors."

    - Always carefully consider **Monthly Inhand Salary** and highlight its importance when determining the result, as salary is a key factor for the credit limit.  
    - If the credit health is classified as **'Poor'**, emphasize the negative factors leading to the suggestion to reject.  
    - Ensure the response is contextually rich, aligns with the provided user profile.
